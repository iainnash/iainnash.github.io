digital dust is a webgl experience on both mobile and desktop that immerses the user in
a 360-degree view of a distorted street but with a virtual layer of superimposed digital
metadata from that location gathered from a combination of the instagram, flickr, and 
foursquare APIs. This data would manifest as huge cubes of images and polygons of 
dust that accumlate from digital activity at the particular place you are viewing.
