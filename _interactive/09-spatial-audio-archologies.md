title: spatial audio archologies performance
date: 2019-6-18
collaboration: chengcheng zhao
summary: we created a piece virtually triggering audio in an empty space that told past histories of the space only through sound. we mapped the same spaces to the different sounds in our lives and premiered a performance going through the space that triggered our own sounds leading to a symphony of all the sounds together as the piece came to a close. participants were invited to explore the soundscape themselves afterwards.
