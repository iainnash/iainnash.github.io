#DateMe was a companion app to the [#dateme off broadway](http://datemeshow.com/#home) show. I built the mobile application component of the project and helped work with design and backend consultants to build a full experience. We engaged the audience and had really good interaction numbers, with an average of over half the audience creating a profile and interacting with the application during the performance.

The app was launched as both an android and ios application and included notifications, profile creation, photo management, and coordinated live with the event lighting cues.
