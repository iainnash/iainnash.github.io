# Tumblr Summer Intern: Iain Nash

This summer I interned at Tumblr as a front end web engineer working with the discovery team. I had amazing opportunities here to build awesome things that many people see, but more important, to work with a creative and dynamic team, and be able to contribute to Tumblr. Additionally, I loved spending the summer in New York - really is an exciting place to be.

I started off getting setup with my own development box and similar access to full time employees at Tumblr. While I started off with smaller projects to get to know the codebase and team, I quickly started getting bigger and bigger projects. It was really overwhelming at first to deploy the tumblr.com codebase within the first week I was here, going from only writing tiny things to a site as big as Tumblr.

The first big project I worked on was making a new logged out tag page. Throughout the summer, I was mostly mentored by Johnny Benson, who really helped me out with how things are done and constant creative and practical decisions involving my work. I also worked with Tag Savage for many of the design changes I was working on. It was always fun for me to hear “if this isn’t too hard to do…,” and be able to make a proof-of-concept by the day’s end. In fact, the current tag page design started off as refinements to a current tag page, then grew into a bigger project when I took these suggestions on. The layout of this page is rather unique - smart sliding rows, and it took a good deal of code to make it work properly.

I also had the opportunity to clean up and improve on some of the already stunning login and register views. These pages were mostly complete, just needing some design and code tweaks. It was a bit nerve wracking deploying these pages as there was a chance I could have missed something and would break login. Most of the changes I made were on the backend PHP, so that going out without a hitch was great for me.

I really enjoyed the other interns at tumblr this summer - previously, I would be the only intern at a company, now I had other interns working with me. Going to lunch, exploring the city was always fun with the other interns.

Now, it is time for me to head back to school at the University of Southern California, and face the homework, the time crunches, and the assignments once again. Seeing Tumblr grow and change over the past few months was a cool experience, and I’m glad I was able to be a part of it.
